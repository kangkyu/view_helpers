```html
<form action="/search" method="get">
```

a **form** html tag with two attributes `action` and `method`
can be generated by Rails

```rb
form_tag("/search", method: "get")
```

`form_tag` helper generates "post" method and "/" action by default

```rb
form_tag
```

can generate

```html
<form action="/" method="post">
```
